# ðŸ“˜ Computer Data Analysis â€“ Project Summary

This repository contains the full implementation of **three course projects** completed as part of the subject **Computer Data Analysis**. The projects are based on the well-known Iris dataset and focus on the practical application of data exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques using Python.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

### âœ… Project 1 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
- Calculated key descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, quartiles, standard deviation).
- Visualized data distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Investigated relationships between features using Pearson correlation and linear regression.

### âœ… Project 2 â€“ Clustering with k-Means
- Normalized the dataset using min-max scaling.
- Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Applied the k-means algorithm and visualized the clusters across different feature pairings.

### âœ… Project 3 â€“ Classification with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Built a k-NN classifier using custom implementation.
- Evaluated classification accuracy for `k` values from 1 to 15.
- Generated confusion matrices and plotted accuracy metrics.
- Repeated the classification for various pairs of features.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Custom Modules:**  
  - `lib_ksrednich.py` â€“ for clustering  
  - `lib_knn.py` â€“ for classification

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Outcomes

This repository demonstrates a full data analysis workflow â€“ from data preprocessing and visualization, through unsupervised clustering, to supervised classification and performance evaluation. It reflects the practical skills and analytical thinking developed throughout the **Computer Data Analysis** course.
